# mergegram_python
Python implementation of mergegram algorithm from the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.11278.pdf) (see algorithm 8.1).

You may find all the examples of using in the corresponding notebook. Note that if you want to try Hi-C data for clustering, you need it to download separately (the link inside the notebook also).
